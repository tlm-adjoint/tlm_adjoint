tlm_adjoint is described in

  J. R. Maddison, D. N. Goldberg, and B. D. Goddard, SIAM Journal on
  Scientific Computing, 41(5), pp. C417--C445, 2019

tlm_adjoint was developed out of a custom extension to dolfin-adjoint, and
previously made use of code derived from dolfin-adjoint, particularly in an
earlier version of the EquationSolver.adjoint_derivative_action method in
tlm_adjoint/_code_generator/equations.py.

Early development work leading to tlm_adjoint was conducted as part of a U.K.
Natural Environment Research Council funded project (NE/L005166/1). Further
development has been conducted as part of a U.K. Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council funded project (EP/R021600/1) and a Natural
Environment Research Council funded project (NE/T001607/1).

The FixedPointSolver class in tlm_adjoint/equations.py derives tangent-linear
and adjoint information using the approach described in [1, 2].

tlm_adjoint implements the binomial checkpointing strategy described in [3].
tlm_adjoint further implements multi-stage offline checkpointing, using a brute
force approach to yield behaviour described in [4].

The TwoLevelCheckpointSchedule class in tlm_adjoint/binomial_checkpointing.py
implements the two-level mixed periodic/binomial checkpointing approach
described in [5, 6].

The interface provided in tlm_adjoint/timestepping.py aims for a degree of
consistency with the API of the 'timestepping' library, as in dolfin-adjoint
timestepping_2017.1.0 branch, and as described in [7].
